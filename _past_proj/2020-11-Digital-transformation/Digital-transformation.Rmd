## Brief Description of Project

In this project, my teammates and I have helped a local SME on how they can pivot their business. Their current business model is vulnerable to external factors, such as global demand, government policies and so on, which could threaten the survival of the business in the future. By studying their current capabilities, we came up with a proposal and strategy on how they could pivot their current business to enter into new business area. In the proposal, we have also laid out the key milestones and potential risks to mitigate to ensure the success of the strategy.


With this new business model, the additional revenue is estimated to be $2 million per annum in addition to current business.

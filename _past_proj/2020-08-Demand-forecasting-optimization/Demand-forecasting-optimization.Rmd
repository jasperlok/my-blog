## Abstract

Our project explored finding the most cost-efficient way of fulfilling the demand of manifacturing factory’s customers in 2012 by using and maximizing the capacities of the firm’s plants. We first carried out demand forecasting using the in-sample and out-sample method to project the monthly demand for each product type and subsequently the individual components. Based on the in-sample trend plot, we deduced the appropriate forecasting method and compared with the out-sample data. Choosing the method with the least mean square error, we used it to forecast the next 12 months demand.



The results from demand forecasting provided crucial data for us to build our optimization model. To construct this model, we considered the 3 main costs associated with the supply chain for the firm – production costs, inventory holding costs and transshipment costs. Furthermore, each plant has different production, holding and transshipment limits across the 12 months of the year and these limits formed important constraints in our optimization model.

## Brief Description of Project

In this challenge, my teammates and I have attempted to improve the ordering process of a distribution and logistics provider based on the sample order frequency of over a period. The objective is to reduce the overall cost of deliveries.


To do so, we first inferred the ordering policy under each retailer based on the sample order data by using various statistical tests. Then these insights were combined with other business strategies, such as how to structure delivery requirements, minimum order requirements and so on, to achieve operational efficiency, resulting in a cost reduction.

Jeng jeng jeng, I suddenly decided to take up a master degree to study data science.\r\nNah, I always wish it is that simple to make such a big decision in life.\r\nIt took me about 5 years to decide that I would go back to university for a data science degree.\r\nIt took me 2.5 years to take the leap to request for a change in job function for the 1st time. \r\nWas I worried or scared during the process? Oh absolutely.\r\nUnconventional Path - Work I have chickened out 2 times after requesting for a change in job function. Eventually I came to the conclusion that I will never step out from my comfort zone if I never take the leap of faith on the 3rd time.\r\nUnfortunately sometimes life is not a bed of roses. Even if it is a bed of roses, it is also a bed of roses with full of thorns.\r\nThings were not as smooth as what I wanted. Teammates left one after another one and things were pretty messy. It was through these tough times I discovered my strength and how I could contribute and make a difference.\r\nFast forward to 1.5 years later, I was being offered to change my job scope again at my work. However, the change was even more drastic. I was being offered to change my job scope from life insurance to general insurance.\r\nAm I scared? Still as worried as usual.\r\nHowever, it took me about 1 day to make up my mind and take the challenge despite of the uncertainty. Even my industry friends were shocked, they even checked with me to verify the news. I knew that worry does not solve anything. I put in the extra effort to understand the fundamental concepts for general insurance.\r\nWithin less 3 months after joining the team, I was asked to cover group insurance while my colleague was on maternity leave. At the moment, I was worried as my main expertise was never in short term insurance business and I was expecting to guide one of the junior on this piece of work. Despite of the hiccups at the beginning, things turned out better than what I initially imagined.\r\nThese past success have nevertheless given more confidence in myself.\r\nUnconventional Path - Data Science Journey I first discovered my interest for data science back in my undergraduate. I still remember it was generalized linear model project on Titanic dataset that sparked my interest. After I started working, I never forget my interest in this area. However, as life goes on, I was not sure this data science was for me since actuarial science and data science are still different (in terms of concepts and work) although they are somewhat similar.\r\nUntil few years ago, I was once exposed a bit on data science at work. That re-kindled my interest for data science. I knew that it is not going to work if I rely others for my learning, eg. waiting to learn from work, waiting for others to teach me and so on. Eventually, I decided to go back to university to study data science.\r\nThroughout these processes, I have encountered many “Why” from myself and others.\r\n“Why would you still want to study, given that you have been studying for your actuarial exams after graduating from university?”\r\n“Why are you still studying this when you hold an actuarial science degree?”\r\n“Why are you studying when your working hours can be quite bad?”\r\n“Why are you spending so much money on getting another degree? Are you sure you can earn back the money?”\r\n“Just why??”\r\nI knew it is going to tough and tiring to work full time + study part time, although I was complaining that I did not its going to be this tiring.\r\nLooking back now, did I regret anything? Absolutely no.\r\nIn fact, I met some of my “gui ren” (ie. people who are great help to one’s life) through my this journey. They have pivoted my life and I knew I could not do this by my own effort.\r\nTakeaway Do I have the certainty of what is going to happen next when I was making the above decisions? Nope, often I am not sure how things will work out.\r\nDo I want to have the certainty in these situations? Oh absolutely yes. However, I knew life does not work this way. I would miss out so much fun if I demand on the certainty.\r\nIt is these unconventional paths that I have discovered amazing things. Just like the the photo shown below, it was taken with no filter during my Japan trip. Instead of walking along the main road like what other tourists were doing, I followed another path that is less taken and discovered this awesome view.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNevertheless, this is my story of unconventional path. Life is short, so live a life with no regret! :)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

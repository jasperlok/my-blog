I am passionate about transforming business through my actuarial and data science knowledge.\r\nAcademic Background\r\nI did my actuarial science undergraduate degree in The Australian National University back in 2009. Ironically I had no clue what actuarial science or statistics is about when I entered into university. It was one of my final year GLM project sparked my interest in statistics and data science.\r\nFast forward to now, I am currently pursuing Master of IT in Business (Analytics) in Singapore Management University.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPhoto by Franki Chamaki on Unsplash\r\nThroughout my study in SMU, I study various types of analytics, including customer analytics, social analytics, visual analytics, and operation analytics, to gain a broad understanding of various analytics techniques.\r\nI also specialize in digital transformation strategy in my master course. During the middle of the pandemic, I also did a consulting job for a local SME that is in the oil & gas industry. The task involves preparing a business proposal on how the SME could leverage its current strength to pivot the current business to venture into a new business market. This would help the SME to ensure its revised business model is more resilient to external market forces.\r\nWork Experience\r\nI have been working in both life insurance and general insurance as an actuary since my first job. Since that, I have worked on the following:  - Product pricing on various life, general, group insurance products  - Experience analysis  - Participating fund management  - Distribution compensation  - Analytics related project  - New business model \r\nDo visit my LinkedIn page if you are interested to find out more on my work experience!\r\nContact\r\nFeel free to contact me on email or LinkedIn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

This would allow the insurers to better reflect the level of premiums based on the underlying risks of the policies. Therefore, in this capstone project, I aim to illustrate how modern data science techniques can be used to complement the traditional actuarial analysis in order to provide the firms competitive advantage. The project will cover how this end to end process, from data exploration and cleaning, model building, visualization and communicating the results could be implemented in RStudio.\r\nMy supervisor for this capstone project is Professor Kam Tin Seong.\r\nDigitation Transformation for a Local SME In this project, my teammates and I have helped a local SME on how they can pivot their business. Their current business model is vulnerable to external factors, such as global demand, government policies and so on, which could threaten the survival of the business in the future. By studying their current capabilities, we came up with a proposal and strategy on how they could pivot their current business to enter into new business area. In the proposal, we have also laid out the key milestones and potential risks to mitigate to ensure the success of the strategy.\r\nWith this new business model, the additional revenue is estimated to be $2 million per annum in addition to current business.\r\nNetwork Characteristics of Fake News The ease of sharing information through online media has arguably benefitted society by creating a more informed populace, many of whom were able to directly benefit from the new jobs created in areas such as advertising and engineering. At the same time, it has been commonly argued that online media has facilitated easy sharing of false information (‘fake news’) which has caused more harm than good to robust public discourse. Governments around the world have been confronted with serious questions about how they should address the spread of fake news online.\r\nIn this group project, my teammates and I have worked together to understand the fake news from a social network perspective. I have studied how fake news “spread” by using network diffusion analysis techniques.\r\nCase Study - Demand Forecasting & Optimization for a Manufacturing Company In this group project, I have worked with my classmates to forecast the demand & allocate the production based on past demand data & the relevant info (eg. cost, constraints and limit) of a manufacturing company provided to us. The goal is to forecast & meet the future demand from different customers though allocating the demand to different plants, while attempting to find the combination that would result in the lowest possible cost.\r\nI was in charge in building the optimization model to find out when and how much to produce, in order to meet the forecast demand with the lowest possible cost. In the report, we also discussed on the various insights from this demand forecasting and optimization case study. We have also suggested a list of action points the company could take in the future to enrich the analysis.\r\nCost Reduction by Improving Order Distribution and Process In this challenge, my teammates and I have attempted to improve the ordering process of a distribution and logistics provider based on the sample order frequency of over a period. The objective is to reduce the overall cost of deliveries.\r\nTo do so, we first inferred the ordering policy under each retailer based on the sample order data by using various statistical tests. Then these insights were combined with other business strategies, such as how to structure delivery requirements, minimum order requirements and so on, to achieve operational efficiency, resulting in a cost reduction.\r\nCustomer Analytics in Retail Industry With the rise of technology and the advent of data analytics, retailers now have access to large amounts of customer data. The challenge currently faced is how to utilise the data to come up with actionable insights and improve on fundamental processes such as customer acquisition and development to eventually boost sales. My classmates and I have demonstrated how retailers can go about this process by using a dataset from Dunnhumby – The Complete Journey.\r\nEach of us has focused on one part of the customer journey. I am responsible to build a simple recommender system. This is to help the company to increase the sales and profits through potential cross-selling and up-selling.\r\nGrocery Maze: Navigating through grocery maze by using Interactive Network Visualization In this era of information explosion, this poses challenges in continuing the current conventional way to analyze association rules. Often these conventional methods do not show the underlying complex relationships between different items. Besides that, the conventional interface of the analytical software lack of interactivity between the graphs and the underlying model. Hence, in this research paper, an alternative way to visualize the association rules is presented. Demonstrations are also included to show interactivity functions are integrated into the application to provide a more seamless process in calibrating the model and visualizing the association rules. The designed application will provide users more control and flexibility.\r\nThe research report and application built in this project can be found in this link.\r\nUp and Down - A Deeper Look into CPI Items In this group project, I have worked with two of my classmates in examining Singapore’s CPI between January 2014 and September 2019 to discover the relationships among the CPI components using Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) method, to aggregate them into clusters with similar price movements.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

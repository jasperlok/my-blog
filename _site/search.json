I am passionate about transforming business\r\nthrough my actuarial and data science knowledge.\r\nAcademic Background\r\nI did my actuarial science undergraduate degree in The Australian\r\nNational University back in 2009. Ironically I had no clue what\r\nactuarial science or statistics is about when I entered into university.\r\nIt was one of my final year GLM project sparked my interest in\r\nstatistics and data science.\r\nIn 2018, I have enrolled myself into Master of IT in Business\r\n(Analytics) in Singapore Management University.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPhoto by Franki Chamaki on Unsplash\r\nThroughout my study in SMU, I studied various types of analytics,\r\nincluding customer analytics, social analytics, visual analytics, and\r\noperation analytics, to gain a broad understanding of various analytics\r\ntechniques.\r\nI also specialized in digital transformation strategy in my master\r\ncourse. During the middle of the pandemic, I also did a consulting job\r\nfor a local SME that is in the oil & gas industry under the guidance\r\nof my SMU professors. The task involved preparing a business proposal on\r\nhow the SME could leverage its current strength to pivot the current\r\nbusiness to venture into a new business market. This would help the SME\r\nto ensure its revised business model is more resilient to external\r\nmarket forces.\r\nI have also written a paper on how modern data science techniques can\r\nbe used to complement conventional actuarial analysis together with my\r\nprofessor Kam Tin Seong. I am honored to share my paper & learning\r\nat Singapore Actuarial Society and useR conference 2021.\r\nWork Experience\r\nI have been working in both life insurance and general insurance as\r\nan actuary since my first job.

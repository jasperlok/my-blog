I am passionate about transforming business through my actuarial and data science knowledge.\r\nAcademic Background\r\nI did my actuarial science undergraduate degree in The Australian National University back in 2009. Ironically I had no clue what actuarial science or statistics is about when I entered into university. It was one of my final year GLM project sparked my interest in statistics and data science.\r\nIn 2018, I have enrolled myself into Master of IT in Business (Analytics) in Singapore Management University.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPhoto by Franki Chamaki on Unsplash\r\nThroughout my study in SMU, I studied various types of analytics, including customer analytics, social analytics, visual analytics, and operation analytics, to gain a broad understanding of various analytics techniques.\r\nI also specialized in digital transformation strategy in my master course. During the middle of the pandemic, I also did a consulting job for a local SME that is in the oil & gas industry under the guidance of my SMU professors. The task involved preparing a business proposal on how the SME could leverage its current strength to pivot the current business to venture into a new business market. This would help the SME to ensure its revised business model is more resilient to external market forces.\r\nI have also written a paper on how modern data science techniques can be used to complement conventional actuarial analysis together with my professor Kam Tin Seong. I am honored to share my paper & learning at Singapore Actuarial Society and useR conference 2021.\r\nWork Experience\r\nI have worked as an actuary in both life insurance and general insurance for the first 10 years of my career before I decided to do a mid career switch into data science.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMy last day at Income + commencement date for my master degree.

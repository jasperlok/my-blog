I am passionate about transforming business through my\r\nactuarial and data science knowledge.\r\nAcademic Background\r\nI did my actuarial science undergraduate degree in The Australian\r\nNational University back in 2009. Ironically I had no clue what\r\nactuarial science or statistics is about when I entered into university.\r\nIt was one of my final year GLM project sparked my interest in\r\nstatistics and data science.\r\nIn 2018, I have enrolled myself into Master of IT in Business\r\n(Analytics) in Singapore Management University.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPhoto by Franki Chamaki on Unsplash\r\nThroughout my study in SMU, I studied various types of analytics,\r\nincluding customer analytics, social analytics, visual analytics, and\r\noperation analytics, to gain a broad understanding of various analytics\r\ntechniques.\r\nI also specialized in digital transformation strategy in my master\r\ncourse. During the middle of the pandemic, I also did a consulting job\r\nfor a local SME that is in the oil & gas industry under the guidance\r\nof my SMU professors. The task involved preparing a business proposal on\r\nhow the SME could leverage its current strength to pivot the current\r\nbusiness to venture into a new business market. This would help the SME\r\nto ensure its revised business model is more resilient to external\r\nmarket forces.\r\nI have also written a paper on how modern data science techniques can\r\nbe used to complement conventional actuarial analysis together with my\r\nprofessor Kam Tin Seong. I am honored to share my paper & learning\r\nat Singapore Actuarial Society and useR conference 2021.\r\nWork Experience\r\nI have worked as an actuary in both life insurance and general\r\ninsurance for the first 10 years of my career before I decided to do a\r\nmid career switch into data science.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMy last day at Income + commencement date for my master degree.\r\nThey happened to be on the same day!\r\nThroughout my career, I have worked on the following:  -\r\nProduct pricing on various life, general and group insurance products\r\n - Experience analysis  - Participating fund management\r\n - Distribution compensation  - End to end machine\r\nlearning related project  - New business model \r\nIn conclusion, my background & experience can be summarized as\r\nfollowing:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nData ScientistPartner Re\r\nAug 2022 - Present\r\n\r\n\r\nMaster of IT in BusinessSingapore Management University\r\nJul 2022\r\n\r\n\r\nVarious Actuarial Functions & RolesNTUC Income Insurance Co-operative Limited\r\nAug 2015 - Jul 2022\r\n\r\n\r\nActuarial Pricing Senior ExecutiveGreat Eastern Life Assurance Co Ltd\r\nOct 2014 - Jun 2015\r\n\r\n\r\nActuarial Pricing Senior ExecutivePrudential Assurance Company Singapore\r\nMar 2012 - Oct 2014\r\n\r\n\r\nBachelor of Actuarial StudiesThe Australian National University\r\nDec 2019\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDo visit my LinkedIn page\r\nor contact me if you are interested to find out more on my work\r\nexperience!\r\nContact\r\nFeel free to contact me on email or LinkedIn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

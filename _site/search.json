I am passionate about transforming business through my actuarial and data science knowledge.\r\nAcademic Background\r\nI did my actuarial science undergraduate degree in The Australian National University back in 2009. Ironically I had no clue what actuarial science or statistics is about when I entered into university. It was one of my final year GLM project sparked my interest in statistics and data science.\r\nIn 2018, I have enrolled myself into Master of IT in Business (Analytics) in Singapore Management University.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPhoto by Franki Chamaki on Unsplash\r\nThroughout my study in SMU, I studied various types of analytics, including customer analytics, social analytics, visual analytics, and operation analytics, to gain a broad understanding of various analytics techniques.\r\nI also specialized in digital transformation strategy in my master course. During the middle of the pandemic, I also did a consulting job for a local SME that is in the oil & gas industry under the guidance of my SMU professors. The task involved preparing a business proposal on how the SME could leverage its current strength to pivot the current business to venture into a new business market. This would help the SME to ensure its revised business model is more resilient to external market forces.\r\nWork Experience\r\nI have been working in both life insurance and general insurance as an actuary since my first job. Since that, I have worked on the following:  - Product pricing on various life, general, group insurance products  - Experience analysis  - Participating fund management  - Distribution compensation  - Analytics related project  - New business model \r\nIn conclusion, my background & experience can be summarized as following:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBachelor of Actuarial StudiesThe Australian National University\r\nDec 2019\r\n\r\n\r\nActuarial Pricing Senior ExecutivePrudential Assurance Company Singapore\r\nMar 2012 - Oct 2014\r\n\r\n\r\nActuarial Pricing Senior ExecutiveGreat Eastern Life Assurance Co Ltd\r\nOct 2014 - Jun 2014\r\n\r\n\r\nActuarial Life Pricing Assistant ManagerNTUC Income Insurance Co-operative Limited\r\nJul 2015 - Jul 2018\r\n\r\n\r\nActuarial Life Reporting Assistant ManagerNTUC Income Insurance Co-operative Limited\r\nJul 2018 - May 2020\r\n\r\n\r\nActuarial Data Analytics ManagerNTUC Income Insurance Co-operative Limited\r\nMay 2020 - Present\r\n\r\n\r\nMaster of IT in BusinessSingapore Management University\r\nAug 2021\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDo visit my LinkedIn page or contact me if you are interested to find out more on my work experience!\r\nContact\r\nFeel free to contact me on email or LinkedIn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

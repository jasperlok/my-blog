I am passionate about transforming business through my actuarial and data science knowledge.\r\nAcademic Background\r\nI did my actuarial science undergraduate degree in The Australian National University back in 2009. Ironically I had no clue what actuarial science or statistics is about when I entered into university. It was one of my final year GLM project sparked my interest in statistics and data science.\r\nFast forward to now, I am currently pursuing Master of IT in Business (Analytics) in Singapore Management University.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPhoto by Franki Chamaki on Unsplash\r\nThroughout my study in SMU, I study various types of analytics, including customer analytics, social analytics, visual analytics, and operation analytics, to gain a broad understanding of various analytics techniques.\r\nI also specialize in digital transformation strategy in my master course. During the middle of the pandemic, I also did a consulting job for a local SME that is in the oil & gas industry. The task involves preparing a business proposal on how the SME could leverage its current strength to pivot the current business to venture into a new business market. This would help the SME to ensure its revised business model is more resilient to external market forces.\r\nWork Experience\r\nI have been working in both life insurance and general insurance as an actuary since my first job. Since that, I have worked on the following:  - Product pricing on various life, general, group insurance products  - Experience analysis  - Participating fund management  - Distribution compensation  - Analytics related project  - New business model \r\nDo visit my LinkedIn page if you are interested to find out more on my work experience!\r\nContact\r\nFeel free to contact me on email or LinkedIn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

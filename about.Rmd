Hi there, welcome to my blog! I am currently working as an actuary and in process of becoming a data scientist. I am passionate about transforming business through my actuarial and data science knowledge.


### Academic Background
I did my actuarial science undergraduate degree in The Australian National University back in 2009. Ironically I had no clue what actuarial science or statistics is about when I entered into university. It was one of my final year GLM project sparked my interest in statistics and data science.

Fast forward to now, I am currently pursuing Master of IT in Business (Analytics) in Singapore Management University.

Throughout my study in SMU, I study various types of analytics, including customer analytics, social analytics, visual analytics, and operation analytics, to gain a broad understanding of various analytics techniques. 


I also specialize in digital transformation strategy in my master course. During the middle of the pandemic, I also did a consulting job for a local SME that is in the oil & gas industry. The task involves preparing a business proposal on how the SME could leverage its current strength to pivot the current business to venture into a new business market. This would help the SME to ensure its revised business model is more resilient to external market forces.


### Work Experience
I have been working in both life insurance and general insurance as an actuary since my first job. Since that, I have worked on the following: <br   />
- Product pricing on various life, general, group insurance products <br   />
- Experience analysis <br   />
- Participating fund management <br   />
- Distribution compensation <br   />
- Analytics related project <br   />
- New business model <br   />

Hi there, welcome to my blog! I am currently working as an actuary and in process of becoming a data scientist. I am passionate about transforming business through my actuarial and data science knowledge.


### Academic Background
I did my actuarial science undergraduate degree in The Australian National University back in 2009. Ironically I had no clue what actuarial science or statistics is about when I entered into university. It was one of my final year GLM project sparked my interest in statistics and data science.

Fast forward to now, I am currently pursuing Master of IT in Business (Analytics) in Singapore Management University.

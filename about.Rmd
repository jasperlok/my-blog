My name is Jasper Lok. I am currently working as an actuary and in process of becoming a data scientist. I am passionate about making a difference in people lives through my actuarial and data science knowledge (eg. solving poverty issues).


I did my undergraduate in The Australian National University back in 2009. Since then, I have been working in both life insurance and general insurance as an actuary. My experience includes product pricing, experience analysis and participating fund management. I am also involved in product pricing for new business models.

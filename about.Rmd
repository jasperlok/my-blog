### About The Author

Hi there, welcome to my blog! I am currently working as an actuary and a data scientist. I am passionate about transforming business through my actuarial and data science knowledge.


### Academic Background
I did my actuarial science undergraduate degree in The Australian National University back in 2009. Ironically I had no clue what actuarial science or statistics is about when I entered into university. It was one of my final year GLM project sparked my interest in statistics and data science.

In 2018, I have enrolled myself into Master of IT in Business (Analytics) in Singapore Management University.

Throughout my study in SMU, I studied various types of analytics, including customer analytics, social analytics, visual analytics, and operation analytics, to gain a broad understanding of various analytics techniques. 


I also specialized in digital transformation strategy in my master course. During the middle of the pandemic, I also did a consulting job for a local SME that is in the oil & gas industry under the guidance of my SMU professors. The task involved preparing a business proposal on how the SME could leverage its current strength to pivot the current business to venture into a new business market. This would help the SME to ensure its revised business model is more resilient to external market forces.


I have also written a paper on how modern data science techniques can be used to complement conventional actuarial analysis together with my professor Kam Tin Seong. I am honored to share my paper & learning at Singapore Actuarial Society and useR conference 2021.


### Work Experience

- Product pricing on various life, general and group insurance products <br   />
- Experience analysis <br   />
- Participating fund management <br   />
- Distribution compensation <br   />
- End to end machine learning related project <br   />

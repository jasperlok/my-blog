Previously, we explored how we could check whether there is any spatial autocorrelation within the dataset. 

In this post, I will be exploring how to check the local measures of spatial autocorrelation.

# What is local spatial autocorrelation?


In this post, I will use local Moran's I to perform analysis.

# Local Moran's I

The formula can be written as follows:

$$I_i=\frac{x_i-\bar{X}}{m_2}\sum_jw_{ij}(x_j-\bar{X})$$

$$m_2=\frac{\sum_i(x_j-\bar{X})^2}{n}$$

where

n is the total number of observations (spatial objects)

$x_i$ is the attribute value of feature i

$x_j$ is the attribute value of feature j

$\bar{X}$ is the mean of this attribute

$w_{ij}$ is the spatial weight between feature i and j

$m_2$ is the constant for all locations. It is a consistent but not unbiased estimate of the variance


The interpretation of local Moran's values is similar to global Moran's I values.


If the p-value is less than 0.05, we will reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is statistical evidence that there is spatial autocorrelation.

- If the z-value is negative, it suggests spatial outlier presence

- If the z-value is positive, it indicates intense clustering of either low or high values


# Demonstration

I will download Malaysia shape files from [this link](https://earthworks.stanford.edu/catalog/stanford-nv753sn0493).

For more explanations on shape files, please refer to my [previous post](https://jasperlok.netlify.app/posts/2022-02-12-point-pattern-analysis/).

I will also use the [total number of newborn babies data](https://www.data.gov.my/data/en_US/dataset/live-births-by-state-administrative-district-and-sex/resource/4d65fb23-3c35-448f-b2c9-49ee57e6fac8) between 2015 and 2021.



## Setup the environment

First, I will set up the environment by calling the necessary packages.

```{r}
pacman::p_load(tidyverse, sf, spdep, tmap, janitor, crosstalk)

```


```{r}
tmap_mode('plot')

```


```{r}
set.seed(1234)

```



## Import the data

### Import shp files

Next, I will import the dataset into the environment.

In this demonstration, I will focus on the total number of new birth in West Malaysia.

```{r}
msia_map <- 
  st_read(dsn = "data", layer = "MYS_adm2") %>% 
  filter(!NAME_1 %in% c("Sabah", "Sarawak", "Labuan"))

```

### Import Malaysia 2015 - 2021 birth rate dataset

I will also import the dataset on 2015 - 2021 birth rate by the administrative district into the environment.

```{r}
msia_birth <- 
  read_csv("data/live-births-by-state-administrative-district-and-sex-2015-2021.csv") %>%
  clean_names() %>%
  filter(year != 2021) %>%
  group_by(year, state, administrative_district) %>%
  summarize(total = sum(value)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = year,
              names_prefix = "total_birth_",
              values_from = total,
              values_fill = 0) %>%
  # change the first letter of each word to capital letter
  mutate(administrative_district = str_to_title(administrative_district)) %>%
  # recode the districts
  mutate(administrative_district_recoded = 
           case_when(administrative_district == "Mualim" ~ "Batang Padang",
                     administrative_district == "Kuala Nerus" ~ "Kuala Terengganu",
                     administrative_district == "Bagan Datuk" ~ "Hilir Perak",
                     administrative_district == "Kecil Lojing" ~ "Gua Musang",
                     administrative_district == "Selama" ~ "Larut and Matang",
                     administrative_district == "Larut & Matang" ~ "Larut and Matang",
                     administrative_district == "Johor Bahru" ~ "Johor Baharu",
                     administrative_district == "Kluang" ~ "Keluang",
                     administrative_district == "Kulai" ~ "Kulaijaya",
                     administrative_district == "Tangkak" ~ "Ledang",
                     administrative_district == "Pasir Puteh" ~ "Pasir Putih",
                     is.na(administrative_district) == TRUE ~ state,
                     TRUE ~ administrative_district)) %>%
  # remove the string so that it can be matched with the naming stated in map data frame
  mutate(administrative_district_recoded = 
           str_replace(administrative_district_recoded, "W.P. ", "")) %>%
  # sum the total number of birth by the recoded administrative districts
  group_by(state, administrative_district_recoded) %>%
  summarise_at(c("total_birth_2015",
                 "total_birth_2016",
                 "total_birth_2017",
                 "total_birth_2018",
                 "total_birth_2019",
                 "total_birth_2020"),
               function(x) sum(x)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  mutate(change_in_birth_2015_2020 = total_birth_2020/total_birth_2015 - 1)

```

## Join the datasets together

As the map is imported as simple features (i.e. one of the data types), this allows us to use the `left_join` function with the total new birth data file.

```{r}
msia_map_birth <-
  msia_map %>%
  left_join(msia_birth,
            by = c("NAME_2" = "administrative_district_recoded"))

```


I will calculate the longitude and latitude.

```{r}
longitude <- map_dbl(msia_map$geometry, ~st_centroid(.x)[[1]])
latitude <- map_dbl(msia_map$geometry, ~st_centroid(.x)[[2]])
coords <- cbind(longitude, latitude)

```


## Spatial weights

Next, I will derive the spatial weights by using K nearest neighbors.

```{r}
kneigh <- knearneigh(coords)
knn <- knn2nb(kneigh)
weight_list_knn <- nb2listw(knn, 
                   style = "W", 
                   zero.policy = TRUE)

```


## Local Spatial Autocorrelation

### Local Moran's I

Now, I will calculate the local Moran I values.

```{r}
locan_moran <-
  localmoran(msia_map_birth$change_in_birth_2015_2020,
             listw = weight_list_knn)

locan_moran

```

### Visualization

To visualize the result, I will merge it with the map data.

```{r}
locan_moran_maps <-
  bind_cols(msia_map_birth, locan_moran)

```

First I will create the graph objects.

```{r}
plot_local_moran <- tm_shape(locan_moran_maps) +
  tm_polygons("Ii")

plot_local_moran_pvalue <- tm_shape(locan_moran_maps) +
  tm_polygons("Pr(z != E(Ii))",
              breaks=c(-Inf, 0.001, 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, Inf))

```

Then I will visualize both graphs by using `tmap_arrange` function.

```{r}
tmap_arrange(plot_local_moran, 
             plot_local_moran_pvalue,
             ncol = 2)

```


From the results above, we observe the following:

- Three of the states in the north have values that statistically different from the neighbors

- Among the three states, the one in the middle seems to have a higher new birth rate than the surrounding

- The state on the right seems to have a lower new birth rate than the surrounding

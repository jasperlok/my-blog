In this post, I will be exploring Prophet.

When I first came across Prophet, I thought the article was referring to the actuarial software until I realised it was for time series forecasting.

Funny enough, the actuarial software Prophet also helps actuaries perform forecasting. Just that the forecasting from the software is more for insurance cashflows.

Nevertheless, in this post, I will exploring Prophet, i.e. one of the time series forecasting method.


# What is Prophet?

Prophet is an open-source library developed by Facebook. 

This method works best with time series that have strong seasonality and several seasons of historical data [@Hyndman2023].

The formula can be written as follows:

$$y_t = g(t) + s(t) + h(t) + \epsilon_t$$

Where

$g(t)$ is the piecewise-linear trend (or “growth term”)

$s(t)$ is the seasonal pattern

$h(t)$ is the holiday effects

$\epsilon_t$ is the white noise error term



# Demonstration

## Setup the environment

First, I will set up the environment by calling all the relevant packages.

I will be using `prophet` package to perform the analysis.

```{r}
pacman::p_load(tidyverse, prophet, readxl)

```


## Import the data

In this demonstration, I will be using the data on outbound departures of Singapore residents by air.

The relevant data can be downloaded from [Singstat website](https://www.singstat.gov.sg/find-data/search-by-theme/industry/tourism/latest-data).

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("image/travel.jpg")

```

```{r}
tour_df <- 
  read_xlsx("data/outputFile.xlsx",
            sheet = "T1",
            range = "A11:EP14") %>% 
  filter(`Data Series` == "Air") %>%
  pivot_longer(!`Data Series`,
               names_to = "time",
               values_to = "value") %>% 
  select(-c(`Data Series`)) %>% 
  mutate(time = ym(time)) %>% 
  filter(time < "2019-01-01") %>% 
  arrange(time)

```



## Visualising the chart

Next, I will visualize the time series by using various `ggplot` functions.

```{r}
ggplot(tour_df, aes(time, value)) +
  geom_line()

```


From the data, we could see that there is some sort of seasonality within the time series.


## Model Building

I will start the time series model.

```{r}
prophet_fit <-
  tour_df %>% 
  rename(ds = time,
         y = value) %>% 
  prophet()

```



## Cross validation

Based on the [documentation page](https://facebook.github.io/prophet/docs/diagnostics.html#:~:text=Cross%20validation,up%20to%20that%20cutoff%20point.), the cross validation can be used to measure the forecast error by using historical data.

To do so, I will be using the `cross_validation` function from the package.

```{r}
prophet_cv <-
  cross_validation(prophet_fit,
                   initial = 365 * 6, # training period
                   period = 30, # how frequent is the estimated value
                   horizon = 365, # forecast horizon
                   units = "days")

```

Note that according to the [documentation page](https://facebook.github.io/prophet/docs/diagnostics.html#:~:text=Cross%20validation,up%20to%20that%20cutoff%20point.), the units in the `cross_validation` function must be some units can be accepted by `as.difftime` function.


Refer to [this link](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/difftime.html) on the units can be accepted by `as.difftime` function.


We could calculate the performance by passing the cross validation results into `performance_metrics` function.

```{r}
performance_metrics(prophet_cv) %>% 
  as_tibble()

```


We could visualize the result by passing the cross validation result to `plot_cross_validation_metric` function.

```{r}
plot_cross_validation_metric(prophet_cv, metric = 'mape')

```

According to the [documentation page](https://facebook.github.io/prophet/docs/diagnostics.html#:~:text=Cross%20validation,up%20to%20that%20cutoff%20point.), the dots show the absolutate percent error for each prediction.

The blue line represents the MAPE, where the mean is taken over a rolling window of the dots.

From the graph, we could see that the forecast errors hover between 3% to 4% most of the times.

The errors seem to increase to somewhere closer to 4% when the predictions are more into the future. 


## Predictions

Next, I will perform predictions on the time series.

I will first append the future time series to the fitted object.

```{r}
future <-
  make_future_dataframe(prophet_fit,
                        periods = 12,
                        freq = "month")

```

If I were to slice the last 12 values from the created object, we can see that its the future values we indicated.

```{r}
tail(future, 12)

```

Then, I will pass the fitted object and created data frame into `predict` function as shown below.

```{r}
forecast <- 
  predict(prophet_fit, future)

```

```{r}
tail(forecast)

```




## Visualization

To visualize the time series, we could pass the fitted object and forecasted values into `plot` function.

```{r}
plot(prophet_fit, forecast)

```

As the generated plot object is a ggplot object as shown below, we could add on ggplot functions to further modify the graph.

```{r}
class(plot(prophet_fit, forecast))

```

```{r}
plot(prophet_fit, forecast) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma) +
  xlab("") +
  ylab("") +
  labs(title = "Number of SG travellers by Air",
       caption = "Data Source: Singstat") +
  theme_minimal()

```


Alternatively, we could visualize the interactive graph by passing the fitted object into `dyplot.prophet` function.

```{r}
dyplot.prophet(prophet_fit, forecast)

```


## Decompose the time series

`prophet_plot_components` function can help us to break the forecast into trend, weekly seasonality, and yearly seasonality.

```{r}
prophet_plot_components(prophet_fit,forecast)

```

From the graph, we note that the number of Singapore residents going overseas through air has increased over the years.

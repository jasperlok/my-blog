In my [previous post](https://jasperlok.netlify.app/posts/2023-01-10-cox-ph/) on Cox Proportional Hazard, I have explored how to perform survival analysis on one event, i.e. the subjects can either experience the event or being censored. 

However, this scenario is often too simplified for real life scenario. We may want to know the subjects "move" around different "states".

This is where multi-state modeling become very handy.

`Survival` package has a nice writeup on [multi-state models and competing risk](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/survival/vignettes/compete.pdf).


# Demonstration

According to CRAN, there are different packages that would help us to model multi-state (e.g. mstate, msm).

In this demonstration, I will be using the functions from `survival` package to model multi-state.


## Setup the environment

First, I will load the necessary packages into the environment.

```{r}
pacman::p_load(tidyverse, survival, tidymodels, condSURV, finalfit)

```



## Import Data

I will be using the German breast cancer dataset from `condSURV` package for the study.

In this dataset, the subjects could have a recurrent breast cancer or died before having another breast cancer. Once have a recurrent breast cancer, the subjects could also "go" to the death state.

The data dictionary for this dataset can be found under this [link](https://web.archive.org/web/20170318010905/http://www.umass.edu/statdata/statdata/data/gbcs.txt).

```{r}
data(gbcsCS)

df <- gbcsCS %>% 
  select(-c(diagdateb, recdate, deathdate)) %>% 
  mutate(
    censdead_comb = case_when(rectime == survtime ~ 1
                              ,rectime != survtime & censdead == 1 ~ 1
                              ,TRUE ~ 0))

rm(gbcsCS)

```

## Model Building
### Single State

One way to model such multiple event is to treat all other non-interest events as "censored" event. However, this could give us a different results, compared to if we were to consider all the events.

For comparison purpose, I will build a simple model with age.

I will fit a Cox Proportional Model on all the death events.

```{r}
cox_fit_single_age <-
  coxph(Surv(survtime, censdead_comb) ~ age
        ,data = df)

cox_fit_single_age

```

From the result, we saw that the likelihood of death decreases when age increases.

This could be there are other significant factors not being captured by the model.




### Multi State

Next, I will use `coxph` function to fit a multi-state model.

First, I will slice the dataset by only keeping the ID and respective predictors to be used in building survival models later on.

```{r}
df_subset <-
  df %>% select(-c(rectime, censrec, survtime, censdead))

```

In order to model the multi-state, we will need to slice the data into the respective exposure.

- `data1` is the dataset that captures the id and respective predictors

- `data2` is the dataset that captures the remaining required by the other arguments

- `id` is the unique identifier for the subject


`tmerge` function also allows us to create new variable within the function.

Below are the variables I created within the `tmerge` function:

- `tstart` and `tstop` to indicate the start and end of each exposure

- `stat_rec` is to indicate whether there is any recurrent of the breast cancer

- `stat_death_comb` is to indicate whether the observed has passed away

- `prior_rec` is to capture whether the observed has recurrent breast cancer

```{r}
df_tmerge <-
  tmerge(
    data1 = df_subset
    ,data2 = df
    ,id = id
    ,stat_death_comb = event(survtime, censdead_comb)
    ,stat_rec = event(rectime, censrec)
    ,prior_rec = tdc(rectime)
    )

```

If we were to call the data, we could see that now each observation is being split into the exposure under each event.

```{r}
head(df_tmerge)

```


If we were to pass the new object to `class` function, we will note that the new object has an additional class, which is "tmerge".

```{r}
class(df_tmerge)

```

Before building the survival model, I will create an additional indicator to capture the event under each time step.

```{r}
df_tmerge_2 <-
  df_tmerge %>% 
  mutate(event = case_when(stat_death_comb == 1 ~ "death"
                           ,stat_rec == 1 ~ "recurrent"
                           ,stat_death_comb == 0 ~ "censored"
                           ,TRUE ~ "check")
         ,event = factor(event))

```


`survival` package offers `survcheck` function to check the data. What I like about this function is it will show the transition matrix.

This would help us in gaining understanding how does the subjects move from states to states.

```{r}
survcheck(Surv(tstart, tstop, event) ~ 1
        ,id = id
        ,data = df_tmerge_2)

```



Again, I will build the multi-state model with just age as the predictor. 

```{r}
cox_fit_multi_age <-
  coxph(Surv(tstart, tstop, event) ~ age
        ,id = id
        ,data = df_tmerge_2)

cox_fit_multi_age

```

From the result, we could see that there are multiple sections since we are trying to fit a multi-state model. The descriptions for the different state can be found in the bottom of the result.

Also, we also noted that the coefficients for age are different under the different transition states.

In general, the likelihood decreases with age when the subjects go from initial state to either death or recurrent states. 

However, the death likelihood increases with age when the subjects have previously experienced a recurrent breast cancer.

Once that is done, I will pass the info to `coxph` function to fit the multi-state model.

Note that at each time step, the data behaves like interval censoring, hence we will indicate the start time and end time of each time step.

We will also need to indicate the unique identifier to the function so that the function knows which rows are belonging to the same group.

```{r}
cox_fit_multi <-
  coxph(Surv(tstart, tstop, event) ~ 
          age
        + menopause
        + hormone
        + size
        + grade
        + nodes
        + prog_recp
        + estrg_recp
        ,id = id
        ,data = df_tmerge_2)

```

If we were to call the fitted object, we can see that the function will fit a model for each possible transition as indicated in the dataset.

```{r}
summary(cox_fit_multi)

```


Alternatively, we will call the `transitions` within the fitted object to see how many observations are under each state.

```{r}
cox_fit_multi$transitions

```

We can check the proportional hazard assumptions by using `cox.zph` function. The proportional hazard assumption should still hold under a multi-state model.

```{r}
cox.zph(cox_fit_multi)

```

#### Graphs

According to the documentation, the `survfit` outputs the probability in state for multi-state model.

Next, we will visualize the probability in state for different events.

Before that, I will generate the `survfit` output.

```{r}
survfit(Surv(tstart, tstop, event) ~ 1, data = df_tmerge_2, id = id)

```
I will use base R plotting function to visualize the result.

```{r}
plot(
  survfit(Surv(tstart, tstop, event) ~ 1
          ,data = df_tmerge_2
          ,id = id)
  ,col=c(1,2,1,2)
  ,lty=c(2,2,1,1)
  ,xlab = "Time"
  ,ylab = "Probability in State")

legend(1800, 0.6, c("death"
                    ,"recurrent")
       ,col=c(1,2)
       ,lwd=2
       ,bty='n')


```


Alternatively, we can use `ggplot` function to plot the probability in state.

```{r}
survfit(Surv(tstart, tstop, event) ~ 1, data = df_tmerge_2, id = id) %>%
  tidy() %>% 
  filter(state != "(s0)") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(time, estimate, color = state)) +
  geom_line() +
  xlab("Time") +
  ylab("Probability in state") +
  theme_minimal()

```



### Another package to fit multi-state Cox model

Also, I happened to come across `finalfit` package that provides a more modular way to fit the multi-state model.

```{r}
explanatory_var <- 
  c("age"
    ,"menopause"
    ,"hormone"
    ,"size"
    ,"grade"
    ,"nodes"
    ,"prog_recp"
    ,"estrg_recp")

dependent_variable <-
  c("Surv(tstart, tstop, event)")

```


```{r}
cox_fit_multi_finalfit <-
  coxphmulti(df_tmerge_2
             ,dependent_variable
             ,explanatory_var
             ,id = df_tmerge_2$id)

```

```{r}
cox_fit_multi_finalfit

```

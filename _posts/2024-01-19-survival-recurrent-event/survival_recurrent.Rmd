# Why do we need separate techniques for recurrent events?

The traditional survival assumes the event of interest can only happen once.

However, some of the event of interests could happen more than once. For example, the cancer survivors could have relapsed.

Therefore, in this post, I will be exploring how to analyze recurrent events.

# Different types of recurrent techniques

Below are the comparisons of the different models:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
recurEvent_df <- tibble(Techniques = c("Counting Process"
                                       ,"Conditional Model A"
                                       ,"Conditional Model B"
                                       ,"Marginal Model")
                        ,Assumptions = c("Assume each event is independent from one another and the u=subject continue contributing to the risk set as long as the subject is under observation at the time the event occurs"
                                         ,"Assume its not possible to be at risk for a subsequent event without having experiened the previous event"
                                         ,"Very useful for modelling the time between each recurrent event rather than the full time course of the recurrent event process"
                                         ,"Consider each event separately and models all the available data for the specific event")
                        ,Remarks = c("- Also known as 'Anderson-Gill model' <br/> 
                                     - Extension of Cox model"
                                     ,"- Also known as 'Prentice-Williams-Peterson counting process' or 'PWP-CP' <br/> 
                                     - Similar to counting process, but stratfied by event <br/> 
                                     - Use this if the order of the event is important"
                                     ,"- Also known as 'Prentice-Williams-Peterson gap process' or 'PWP-GT' <br/>

                                     - Use this if the interest is time to next recurrent event"
                                     ,"- Strata by event + cluster by id <br/>
                                     - Use this if we want to know the events occuring at different order <br/>
                                     - Strata by event + cluster by id
                                     - Each observation must have equal number of rows"))


recurEvent_df %>%
  kbl(escape = FALSE) %>%
  #kable_styling()
  kable_paper("hover", full_width = F, html_font = "Cambria", font_size = 15)

```


With the different types of recurrent models, it can be quite confusing which models we should be using. 

This author summarizes a few key considerations in guiding us in picking the appropriate models [@Ghilotti2018]:

- Is the order of the events important?  

- Does the risk of recurrent event change as the number of previous events increases?

- Are we interested in the overall effect or in the effect for the $k^{th}$ event?

- Are there many recurrences per subject?


The authors of this article have provided how the codes would look like under the different models [@Guo2009].


# What is the difference between recurrent survival analysis and Poisson regression?

[@Yang2017] explained following are the differences:

- Poisson regression is a fully parametric model, where Cox model is semi-parametric

- If the survival time follows an exponential distribution, then Poisson regression is equivalent to a parametric survival model assuming exponential distribution

- If survival time is not exponentially distributed and the event count does not follow a Poisson distribution, the inference made from Poisson regression may be biased

The author also highlighted one should be careful when using Poisson regression to analyze recurrent events because of the strong parametric assumptions.

# Demonstration

In this demonstration, I will be using the bladder dataset in `survival` package for the exploration.


## Setup the environment

First, I will load the necessary packages into the environment.

```{r}
pacman::p_load(tidyverse, janitor, survival, survminer)

```



## Import Data

First I will import the dataset into the environment. 

I will also clean the column names, drop the columns I don't need and transform the columns to be the right format.

```{r}
data(cancer, package = "survival")

df <- bladder1

```


```{r}
df_1 <- df %>% 
  mutate(event = if_else(recur == 0, 0, 1))

```

# Counting Process

First, I will build a counting process. 

Under this model, each event is assumed to be independent. 

```{r}
recur_fit <-
  coxph(Surv(start, stop, event) ~ treatment + status + cluster(id)
        ,data = df_1)

```

```{r}
summary(recur_fit)

```


```{r}
ggsurvplot(survfit(recur_fit, data = df_1))

```


# Conditional Model A

Next, I will be building a conditional model A.

Under this model, we assume that it is not possible to be at risk for subsequent event without experiencing the prior event.

```{r}
recur_fit_conditional_a <-
  coxph(Surv(start, stop, event) ~ treatment + status + cluster(id) + strata(enum)
        ,data = df_1)

```


```{r}
summary(recur_fit_conditional_a)

```

```{r}
ggsurvplot(survfit(recur_fit_conditional_a, data = df_1))

```


# Conditional Model B

I will build a conditional model B.

```{r}
recur_fit_conditional_b <-
  coxph(Surv(stop - start, event) ~ treatment + status + cluster(id) + strata(enum)
        ,data = df_1)

```


```{r}
summary(recur_fit_conditional_b)

```

```{r}
ggsurvplot(survfit(recur_fit_conditional_b, data = df_1))

```


# Marginal model

Lastly, I will build a marginal model.

Under this approach, each event is assumed to be a separate process. 

```{r}
recur_fit_marginal <-
  coxph(Surv(stop, event) ~ treatment + status + cluster(id) + strata(enum)
        ,data = df_1)

```

```{r}
summary(recur_fit_marginal)

```

```{r}
ggsurvplot(survfit(recur_fit_marginal, data = df_1))

```

Hmmm, it seems like the coefficients of the different models are different. It made me curious how different they are.

To compare the different coefficients, I will first compile the results.

```{r}
recurrent_model_coef_df <- 
  bind_rows(
    # counting process
    data.frame(summary(recur_fit)$coefficients) %>% 
      rownames_to_column("variable") %>% 
      clean_names() %>% 
      mutate(model = "counting process")
    # conditional model A
    ,data.frame(summary(recur_fit_conditional_a)$coefficients) %>% 
      rownames_to_column("variable") %>% 
      clean_names() %>% 
      mutate(model = "conditional model a")
    # conditional model B
    ,data.frame(summary(recur_fit_conditional_b)$coefficients) %>% 
      rownames_to_column("variable") %>% 
      clean_names() %>% 
      mutate(model = "conditional model b")
    # marginal model
    ,data.frame(summary(recur_fit_marginal)$coefficients) %>% 
      rownames_to_column("variable") %>% 
      clean_names() %>% 
      mutate(model = "marginal model")
  )

```

Then, I will compare the results by using `ggplot` functions.

```{r}
recurrent_model_coef_df %>% 
  ggplot(aes(variable, coef, color = model)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = coef - robust_se
                    ,ymax = coef + robust_se)) +
  xlab("Variables") +
  ylab("Coefficients") +
  labs(title = "Coefficients from Different Recurring Models")

```

Over here, I hasve used the robust errors in calculating the confidence interval as robust error terms would have account for the correlation.

This is because an individual could have multiple events and this measurement will account for the correlation.

Based on the graph, we could see that the confidence interval range for the coefficients overlap with one another.

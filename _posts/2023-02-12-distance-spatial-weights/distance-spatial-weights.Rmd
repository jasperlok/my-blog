Previously we discussed contiguity-based spatial weight.

In this post, we will focus on another spatial weighting method, which is **distance-based spatial weights**.



# What is distance-based spatial weight?

[@Rey2020] explained that distance-based weight can be defined as neighbour relations as a function of the distance separating spatial observations.

In other words, this approach determines who are the neighbours by using the distance, instead of which areas are connected.


# Types of distance-based spatial weights

Below are two common distance-based spatial weights approaches:

**K nearest neighbours weights**

[@Rey2020] defines this type of distance-based weight as the neighbour set of a particular observation containing its nearest k observations, where the user specifies the value of k.


**Fixed distance**

As the name suggested, this approach defines to be the neighbour of the selected district, the distance between them must be within the specified range.

We will see more about how this fixed distance spatial weight works in the demonstration.



# Best practice on how to select the appropriate spatial weighting method

This was discussed in my previous post.

Please refer to the [previous post](https://jasperlok.netlify.app/posts/2023-02-05-contiguity-spatial-weights/) for more info.

# Demonstration

I will download Malaysia shape files from [this link](https://earthworks.stanford.edu/catalog/stanford-nv753sn0493).

For more explanations on shape files, please refer to my [previous post](https://jasperlok.netlify.app/posts/2022-02-12-point-pattern-analysis/).


## Setup the environment

First, I will setup the environment by calling the necessary packages.

```{r}
pacman::p_load(tidyverse, sf, spdep, tmap, janitor)

```

I will also set the `tmap_mode` to `view` so that I can interact with the graphs.

```{r}
tmap_mode('view')

```

## Import the data

### Import shp files

Next, I will import the dataset into the environment.

```{r}
msia_map <- st_read(dsn = "data", layer = "MYS_adm2")

```

Next, I will visualize the Malaysia map.

```{r}
tm_shape(msia_map) +
  tm_polygons()

```

Good! Now, we can proceed and find the "neighbours".


## Distance-based spatial weight

In this sub-section, I will derive the distance-based spatial weights.

To better visualize the spatial weights results later, I will find the centroids of different administrative districts.

```{r}
longitude <- map_dbl(msia_map$geometry, ~st_centroid(.x)[[1]])
latitude <- map_dbl(msia_map$geometry, ~st_centroid(.x)[[2]])

```

Once the latitude and longitude are derived, I will use `cbind` function to bind the columns together.

```{r}
coords <- cbind(longitude, latitude)

```

### K Nearest Neighbours

I will pass the created `coords` object into `knearneigh` function.

```{r}
kneigh <- knearneigh(coords, k = 4)

```

According to the [documentation](https://r-spatial.github.io/spdep/reference/knearneigh.html), the function returns a matrix with the indices of points belonging to the set of k nearest neighbours of each other.

I have sliced the first 10 rows from the data to have a look at who are their neighbours.

```{r}
kneigh$nn[1:10, 1:4]

```

Once we find the neighbours, we will use `knn2nb` function to convert the objects into `nb` so that we can use the plot function to visualize the results.

```{r}
knn <- knn2nb(kneigh)

```




Fantastic!

I will then pass the objects to the plotting function to visualize the results.

```{r}
plot(msia_map$geometry, border = "lightgrey")
plot(knn, coords, add = TRUE, col = "blue")

```

Noted that under this approach, everyone has the same number of neighbours.

### Fixed distance

Now, let's move on to another distance-based spatial weight approach, which is fixed distance.

To do so, I will use `dnearneigh` function.

I will need to specify the lower and upper distance bounds in the function.

Over here, I have specified the lower and upper distance bounds are 0 and 100 respectively.

```{r}
fixed_d <- dnearneigh(coords, 0, 100, longlat = TRUE)

```

`spdep` package offers a function to extract the number of neighbours of each area.

```{r}
card(fixed_d)

```

Oh no! Some of the districts (i.e. the two colored districts in the graph below) don't have any neighbours as they seem to be far from everyone.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
msia_map_ind <-
  msia_map %>%
  mutate(ind = if_else(NAME_2 %in% c("Belaga", "Kapit"), "1", "0"))

tm_shape(msia_map_ind) +
  tm_polygons(
    "ind"
    ,id = "NAME_2"
    ,palette = c(
        "0" = "lightgrey"
        ,"1" = "tomato")
    ,legend.show = FALSE)

```

So if we were to visualize the result by using our usual plotting function, we will see that there are two nodes within the graph that don't have any edges.


```{r}
plot(msia_map$geometry, border = "lightgrey")
plot(fixed_d, coords, add = TRUE, col = "blue")

```


To overcome this issue, we could increase the upper distance bound to a higher number.

As such, we will find the largest distance between the first nearest neighbours and 

In this example, I will take the max distance from K nearest neighbours as the upper distance bound.


Then I will use `nbdists` function to calculate the Euclidean distances along the links.

```{r}
dist_new <- nbdists(knn, coords, longlat = TRUE)

```

Then I will unlist the object to convert it into a list before passing it to `summary` function to find the summary statistics.

```{r}
dist_new_unlist <- unlist(dist_new)

```


```{r}
summary(dist_new_unlist)

```

Great!

The largest distance between the first nearest neighbours is 163.055km from the summary statistics shown above.

*Taken from giphy*

Now, we can find the neighbours by using the updated upper distance bound.

```{r}
fixed_d_new <- dnearneigh(coords, 0, 163.1, longlat = TRUE)

plot(msia_map$geometry, border = "lightgrey")
plot(fixed_d_new, coords, add = TRUE, col = "blue")

```

Now all the districts have "neighbours".

We can also call the created object to see the summary result.


```{r}
fixed_d_new

```

From the result, we noted the following:

- There are about 3,120 edges in total

- On average, each district has 21.6667 neighbours

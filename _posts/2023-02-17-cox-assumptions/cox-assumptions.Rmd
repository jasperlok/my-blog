In [previous post](https://jasperlok.netlify.app/posts/2023-01-10-cox-ph/), I have explored on how to build a Cox proportional hazard model.

In this post, I will be exploring how to check the proportional hazard assumption in the model.


# Test Cox proportional hazard

One of the main assumptions is the hazard functions are proportional to one another over the period.


To check whether the proportional hazard is appropriate, we will perform statistical test based on scaled Schoenfeld residuals.


If the p-value is significant, the proportional hazard assumption doesn't hold [@StackExchange2019].


## When proportional hazard assumption is inappropriate

When the proportional hazard assumption does not hold, there are several approaches to overcome this [@Sestelo2017].

- Stratify the variable

- Partition of the time axis

- Check on the nonlinear effect

In this post, I will focus on how to stratify the variable.

# Strata

[@Todd2017] explained that in a Cox model, stratification allows for as many different hazard functions as there are strata. 

Beta coefficients (hazard ratios) optimized for all strata are then fitted.


# Demonstration

In this demonstration, I will be using this [bank dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shrutimechlearn/churn-modelling) from Kaggle.

## Setup the environment

First, I will load the necessary packages into the environment.

```{r}
pacman::p_load(tidyverse, lubridate, janitor, survival, survminer)

```

## Import Data

First I will import the dataset into the environment. 

I will also clean the column names, drop the columns I don't need and transform the columns to be the right format.

```{r}
df <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jasperlok/my-blog/master/_posts/2022-09-10-kaplan-meier/data/Churn_Modelling.csv") %>%
  clean_names() %>%
  select(-c(row_number, customer_id, surname)) %>%
  mutate(has_cr_card = factor(has_cr_card),
         is_active_member = factor(is_active_member),
         credit_score = credit_score/100,
         balance = balance/10000,
         estimated_salary = estimated_salary/10000) %>%
  filter(tenure > 0)

```


## Test Cox Proportional assumption

Before we could check the proportional hazard assumption, I will build a simple model.

```{r}
cox_model <- 
  coxph(Surv(tenure, exited) ~ estimated_salary, 
        data = df, 
        x = TRUE, 
        y = TRUE)

```

To check the assumption, I will pass the fitted model to `cox.zph` function as follows:

```{r}
cox.zph(cox_model)

```

From the result, the p-value is greater than 0.05, suggesting the proportional hazard assumption is appropriate for this simple model.

To visualize the result, we could pass the result from `cox.zph` function to `plot` function.

```{r}
plot(cox.zph(cox_model))

```


Alternatively, we can pass the result from `cox.zph` function to `ggcoxzph` function to visualize the result.

According to [R documentation](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/survminer/versions/0.4.9/topics/ggcoxzph), `ggcoxzph` function is a wrapper around `plot.cox.zph` function.

```{r}
ggcoxzph(
  cox.zph(cox_model)
)

```

Below are some of the interpretations of the result [@Sampada2019]:

- Solid line represents the smoothing spline fit for the plot

- Dashed lines represent +/- 2 standard error bands around the fit

- If the p-value is less than 0.05, then the assumption is violated

    - Assumption: the hazard ratio is not constant over time

    - Assume a non-significant relationship betweeen residuals and time

Next, I will check the proportional hazard assumption under a multivariate model.

Similarly, I will build a multivariate model first.

```{r}
cox_model_all <- 
  coxph(Surv(tenure, exited) ~ credit_score + gender + balance + age + num_of_products + has_cr_card + is_active_member + estimated_salary, 
        data = df, 
        x = TRUE, 
        y = TRUE)

```

Then, I will pass the result to `cox.zph` function.

```{r}
cox.zph(cox_model_all)

```
From the result, we note that the overall p-value is still greater than 0.05, although the p-value for `balance` is less than 0.05.

Based on this [discussion post](https://discourse.datamethods.org/t/how-to-calculate-the-heterogeneity-p-value-for-a-variable-in-two-cox-regression-models/1661/5), the author suggested since the overall test has a near-perfect multiplicity adjustment, individual tests probably is not so crucial if global p-value is greater than 0.2 unless the individual $\rho$ value (i.e. correlation between Schoenfeld residual and time) is very high.


Next, I will visualize the result by using `ggcoxzph` function.

Given the number of variables used to build the model, the graph will be hard to read.

Hence, I will make some modifications to the graphs produced.

```{r}
ggcoxzph(
    cox.zph(cox_model_all)
    ,font.x = 8
    ,font.y = 7
    ,font.tickslab = 8
    ,font.main = 8)

```

Similar results can be observed.

If I were to convert the balance into categorical variable and visualize the survival curve, we will note that one of the survival curve interacts other curves. 

```{r}
df_grp <-
  df %>%
  mutate(balance_grp = cut(balance, breaks = c(-Inf, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30)))

ggsurvplot(survfit(Surv(tenure, exited) ~ balance_grp, data = df_grp),
           data = df_grp)

```



## Stratify the variable

In this demonstration, I will explore using stratification.

To do so, I will re-build the model by stratifying the balance variable.

```{r}
cox_model_all_balance_strata <- 
  coxph(Surv(tenure, exited) ~ credit_score + gender + age + num_of_products + has_cr_card + is_active_member + estimated_salary + strata(balance), 
        data = df, 
        x = TRUE, 
        y = TRUE)

```


```{r}
cox_model_all_balance_strata

```



After stratifying the variable, the overall p-value increases.

```{r}
cox.zph(cox_model_all_balance_strata)

```

Similarly, I will visualize the result by using `ggcoxzph` function.

```{r}
ggcoxzph(
    cox.zph(cox_model_all_balance_strata)
    ,font.x = 8
    ,font.y = 7
    ,font.tickslab = 8
    ,font.main = 8)

```


Lastly, I will extract the concordance results from the original & stratified models for comparison.

```{r}
cox_model_all$concordance["concordance"]
cox_model_all_balance_strata$concordance["concordance"]

```

The concordance result improves slightly after we stratify `balance`.

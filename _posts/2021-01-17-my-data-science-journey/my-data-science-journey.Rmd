During a stormy night in 2018, it was raining cats and dogs outside. Suddenly there was thunder and lightning. Jeng jeng jeng, I suddenly decided to take up the master degree in Singapore Management University to study more on data science.

Nah, how I decided to embark this data science journey is not so dramatic. I always wish it is that simple to make such a big decision in life.

As discussed in the previous post, RCTs might not be practical in some
occasions.

Hence, this is where other techniques can be used to study the causal
effect.

In this post, we will be looking at how does difference-in-differences
work.

# What is difference-in-differences?

[@DS4PS] This method allows us to analyze the effect by taking into
consideration:

-   how the group mean changes before and after a policy intervention
    and

-   compare this change with the mean over time of a similar group which
    did not undergo the treatment (i.e., control group)

The formula of difference-in-differences can be written as follows:
$$Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 * treatment + \beta_2 * post + \beta_3 * treatment * post + \epsilon$$

Where Y is the outcome variable

The key is to check whether the interaction term is statistically
significant. If the term is significant, it would indicate that the
before and after treatment effect is indeed not zero.

# Why use this method?

This method is rather easy to understand.

Also, we need not to care about the effect of confounding variables
while using this method.

# Important considerations

To use such a method, we need to check the following assumptions:

-   Parallel trends

We can check this by using visual inspection.

This can also be checked by running a difference-in-difference analysis
on the earlier period.

The interaction term should not be statistically significant, otherwise
it would indicate that the parallel trend assumption is being violated.

-   Treatment timing

One issue to take note of is when the groups receive treatment as this
could distort the estimate.

To resolve this issue, we could use Goodman-Bacon decomposition to
study, which I won't be exploring this method in this analysis.

# Best practices for performing differences-in-differences analysis

Below are some best practices when using difference-in-difference
approach [@Fernandez]:

-   Be sure outcome trends did not influence the allocation of the
    treatment/intervention

-   Acquire more data points before and after to test parallel trend
    assumption

-   Use linear probability model to help with interpretability

-   Be sure to examine composition of population in
    treatment/intervention and control groups before and after
    intervention

-   Use robust standard errors to account for autocorrelation between
    pre/post in same individual

-   Perform sub-analysis to see if intervention had similar/different
    effect on components of the outcome

# Demonstration

In this post, I will be using the following packages to perform the
analysis.

```{r}
pacman::p_load(tidyverse, haven, broom)

```

## Import Data

I will be using the dataset shared by Professor Andrew Heiss on his
teaching website. I have also referenced the materials and problem set
he posted on the course website.

Refer to [this
link](https://evalsp23.classes.andrewheiss.com/assignment/04-problem-set.html)
for the dataset.

```{r}
eitc <- read_stata("data/eitc.dta") %>% 
  mutate(children_cat = case_when(
    children == 0 ~ "0",
    children == 1 ~ "1",
    children >= 2 ~ "2+"
  ))

```

This dataset comes from US Census's Current Population Survey. The
objective of the analysis is to find out whether the number of
employment for women increased after the implementation of Earned Income
Tax Credit in 1993.

Below are the definitions of the columns in the dataset:

-   `state`: The woman's state of residence. The numbers are Census/CPS
    state numbers: <http://unionstats.gsu.edu/State_Code.htm>
-   `year`: The tax year
-   `urate`: The unemployment rate in the woman's state of residence
-   `children`: The number of children the woman has
-   `nonwhite`: Binary variable indicating if the woman is not white (1
    = Hispanic/Black)
-   `finc`: The woman's family income in 1997 dollars
-   `earn`: The woman's personal income in 1997 dollars
-   `age`: The woman's age
-   `ed`: The number of years of education the woman has
-   `unearn`: The woman's family income minus her personal income, in
    *thousands* of 1997 dollars

```{r}
eitc <- 
  eitc %>% 
  mutate(ind_any_kids = if_else(children_cat == "0", "no", "yes")
         ,ind_after_1993 = if_else(year <= 1993, "no", "yes"))

```

## Difference-in-differences analysis

### Check assumptions

#### Similar

```{r}
eitc %>% 
  ggplot(aes(children_cat, work)) +
  stat_summary(geom = "pointrange", fun.data = "mean_se", fun.args = list(mult = 1.96))

```

#### Parallel Assumptions

First, I will calculate the average employment by year and whether the
women have any kids.

```{r}
eitc_by_year_kids <-
  eitc %>% 
  group_by(year, ind_any_kids) %>% 
  summarise(count_total = n()
            ,work_total = sum(work)) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  mutate(work_avg = work_total/count_total)

```

##### Visual Inspect

Then, I will visualize the result by using `ggplot` function.

```{r}
ggplot(eitc_by_year_kids, aes(year, work_avg, color = ind_any_kids)) +
  geom_line() +
  theme_minimal() +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 1994) +
  annotate("text",x = 1992.9,y = 0.45,label = "<---- Before Treatment") +
  annotate("text",x = 1995,y = 0.45,label = "After Treatment ---->") +
  xlab("Year") +
  ylab("Average Employment") +
  labs(title = "Average Employment by Year")

```

It seems like the pre-treatment trends between the two groups appear to
be the same.

This is important as this would allow us to isolate the effect of the
tax credit in the later step.

##### Check by using earlier data

Another method to check the parallel trend pattern is to build a model
based on earlier period data.

If the parallel trend assumption holds, then the interaction term would
not be statistically significant.

With that, I will build a model for a period between 1991 and 1993.

```{r}
eitc_fake_treatment <- eitc %>% 
  filter(year < 1994) %>% 
  mutate(after_1991 = year >= 1992
         ,ind_year_1991 = if_else(year <= 1991, "yes", "no"))

model_fit_fake_treat <-
  lm(work ~ ind_any_kids + ind_year_1991 + ind_any_kids * ind_year_1991
     ,data = eitc_fake_treatment)

tidy(model_fit_fake_treat)

```

As shown in the result above, the interaction term is not statistical
significant, suggesting that the parallel term assumption is
appropriate.

Nevertheless, let's start by estimating the causal effect.

### Manual Calculation on the Treatment Effect

Next, I will compute the average employment under each group.

```{r}
eitc_manul_calc <-
  eitc %>% 
  group_by(ind_any_kids, ind_after_1993) %>% 
  summarise(work_avg = mean(work))

eitc_manul_calc

```

Then, I will estimate the causal effect.

```{r}
eitc_manul_calc[1,3] - eitc_manul_calc[3,3] - (eitc_manul_calc[2,3] - eitc_manul_calc[4,3])

```

### Estimated Effect by using Regression

Instead of calculating manually, we could also fit a regression line to
compute the causal effect.

```{r}
model_fit_simple <-
  lm(work ~ ind_after_1993 + ind_any_kids + ind_after_1993 * ind_any_kids
     ,data = eitc)

tidy(model_fit_simple)

```

Ta-da! Now we have computed the causal effect.

Note that the estimated causal effect is the same as the computed figure
in the earlier step.

There is statistical evidence that the tax credits increases the average
employment for women with kids.

### Control the effects of other variables

We could take one step further to include other variables in the formula
so that we could control their respective effects.

```{r}
model_fit_complex <-
  lm(work ~ ind_after_1993 + ind_any_kids + ind_after_1993 * ind_any_kids + unearn + children + nonwhite + poly(age, 2) + poly(ed, 2)
     ,data = eitc)

tidy(model_fit_complex)

```

After controlling for other effects, the treatment effect is about 0.058
now. The causal effect of tax credits remains statistically significant.

### Varying Treatment Effect

As shown in the data, the subject could have more than 1 kid.

Therefore, we could split the "having kids indicator" into two so that
we could estimate the causal effect of having one kid and more than one
kid separately.

```{r}
eitc <-
  eitc %>% 
  mutate(ind_one_kid = if_else(children_cat == "1", "yes", "no")
         ,ind_two_plus_kids = if_else(children_cat == "2+", "yes", "no"))


model_fit_two_simple <-
  lm(work ~ ind_after_1993 + ind_one_kid + ind_two_plus_kids + ind_after_1993 * ind_one_kid + ind_after_1993 * ind_two_plus_kids
     ,data = eitc)

tidy(model_fit_two_simple)

```

It seems like the treatment effect is greater for women with two or more
kids.

Also, the causal effect is only significant for the women with more than
1 kid.

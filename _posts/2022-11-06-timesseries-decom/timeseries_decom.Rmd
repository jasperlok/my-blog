This post continues our previous topic on time series.

As the name of the post suggested, we will be breaking the time series into different components.

# Time series components

In general, time series can be seen as made out of following components:

- Trend

- Seasonal

- Remainder


It can be written in following mathematical format:

$$y_t = S_t + T_t + R_t$$

where

- $S_t$ is the seasonal component

- $T_t$ is the trend component

- $R_t$ is the remainder component


While the above mathematical expression shows the additive time series decomposition, it can be written as multiplicative decomposition as well.

$$y_t = S_t \times T_t \times R_t$$

# So when should we use additive or multiplicative components?

This depends on the magnitude of seasonal variations or variation around trend.

If the variation seems to be increasing by time, then multiplicative components are likely to be more suitable.


# Differences between the different methods

There are several methods in decomposing the time series [@Hyndman2021]:


```{r, echo = FALSE}
time_series_decom <- tibble(Method = c("Classical decomposition", 
                                       "X11 decomposition",
                                       "SEATS decomposition",
                                       "STL decomposition"),
                            Remarks = c("Some of the problems with this method:<br/>- the estimate of trend is not available for first few and last few observations<br/>- trend estimate tends to over-smooth rapid rises and falls<br/>- assume the seasonal components repeats from year to year, which may not be reasonable<br/>- not robust to outliers", 
                                     "Based on classical decomposition, but includes many extra steps and features to overcome the drawbacks of classical decomposition", 
                                     "The full name is 'seasonal extraction in ARIMA time series'<br/><br/>This method only works with quarterly and monthly data", 
                                     "The full name is 'seasonal decomposition of time series by Loess'<br/><br/>Following are the advantages over the classical, SEATS and X11 decomposition methods:<br/>- Unlike SEATS and X11, this method handles any type of seasonality, not only monthly and quarterly data<br/>- Seasonal component is allowed to change over time<br/>- Seasonal component and smoothness of the trend can be controlled by the user<br/>- Trend and seasonal component of this method is robust to outliers"))

# Demonstration

Since the high inflation has been a hot topic, in this demonstration, I will be using the consumer price index dataset I obtained from Singstat website.

## Setup the environment

First, I will setup the environment by calling the necessary packages.

```{r}
pacman::p_load(tidyverse, lubridate, timetk, tsibble, janitor, feasts, fable, seasonal)

```

Next, I will import the dataset into the environment.

```{r}
df <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jasperlok/my-blog/master/_posts/2022-10-23-timesseries/data/M212881.csv", 
               skip = 10) %>%
  slice(1:148) %>%
  filter(`Data Series` != "Hawker Centres" &
           `Data Series` != "Food Courts & Coffee Shops")

```

As some of the columns are imported in incorrect column types, I will use `sapply` function to convert the columns into the correct column types.

```{r}
cols_num <- c(2:ncol(df))

df[cols_num] <- sapply(df[cols_num], as.numeric)

```

Once the columns are imported into the correct types, I will reshape the dataset by using `pivot_longer` function.

```{r}
start_date <- "2014-01-01"
end_date <- "2021-12-01"

```

```{r}
df_1 <- df %>%
  pivot_longer(!`Data Series`, names_to = "Month Year", values_to = "CPI") %>%
  clean_names() %>%
  mutate(month_year_recoded = ym(month_year)) %>%
  select(-month_year) %>%
  filter(month_year_recoded >= start_date & month_year_recoded <= end_date)

```

`as_tsibble` function is to convert the dataset into tsibble dataframe.

We will pass month_year_recoded into `index` argument.

As another thing to take note is we need to pass info

```{r}
df_1_ts <- df_1 %>%
  mutate(month_year_recoded = yearmonth(month_year_recoded)) %>%
  as_tsibble(index = month_year_recoded,
             key = data_series)

```

# Decompose the time series

In this demonstration, I will be using one of the items to demonstrate on how we could decompose the time series.

```{r}
interested_cpi_item <- "Clothing & Footwear"

```

Before jumping into the time series decomposition, let's look at the time series again.

```{r}
df_1_ts %>%
  filter(data_series == interested_cpi_item) %>%
  autoplot() +
  xlab("") +
  ylab("CPI") +
  labs(title = paste0("CPI Time Series of ", interested_cpi_item)) +
  theme_minimal()

```



### Classical Decomposition

From the graph, it seems like the seasonality or variation around time series are quite consistent throughout the period.

Hence, I will indicate the type should be "additive" in the `type` argument in `classical_decomposition` function.

```{r}
classical_model <- df_1_ts %>%
  filter(data_series == interested_cpi_item) %>%
  model(classical_decomposition(type = "additive"))

classical_model

```

The output consists of the selected data series and the model. 

To extract the info of the fitted model, I will use the `components` function.


```{r}
classical_model %>%
  components()

```

Aside from the fitted values (i.e. trend, seasonal, random and season_adjust), it also contains the original time series value (i.e. cpi in this demonstration).


As the default value for seasonality in `classical_decomposition` function is 12 (which 12 means its a monthly seasonality), we can observe that the `trend` and `random` column do not contain any value for the first 6 months and last 6 months.


We can visualize the different components by passing the objects into `autoplot` function as shown below.


```{r}
classical_model %>%
  components() %>%
  autoplot()

```

Note that there are some grey bars on the left side of the graphs. 


Those bars represents the relative scales of the different components since all the components are plotted under different scales.

In other words, it probably be easier to understand the bars as how much we have "zoomed in" to illustrate the components. 

The longer the bar, the more we have "zoomed in".

Personally, I find the bars can cause some confusion when I try to explain the graph. 

To avoid the unnecessary confusion, we can turn off the `scale_bars` by passing `FALSE` into the argument.

```{r}
classical_model %>%
  components() %>%
  autoplot(scale_bars = FALSE)

```


We can also change the seasonality to other values.

Following are the values for the seasonality:

```{r}
seasonality_df <- tibble(Value = c("4", "12", "7"),
                         `Corresponding seasonality` = c("Quarterly",
                                                         "Monthly",
                                                         "Daily"))

seasonality_df %>%
  kbl(escape = FALSE) %>%
  kable_paper("hover", full_width = F, html_font = "Cambria", font_size = 15)

```

So, if I were to change the seasonality to quarterly seasonality, below are the components of the revised model:

```{r}
df_1_ts %>%
  filter(data_series == interested_cpi_item) %>%
  model(classical_decomposition(cpi ~ season(4),
                                type = "additive")) %>%
  components() %>%
  autoplot()

```

This revised decomposition model seems to "perform" worse than the decomposition model with monthly seasonality.

Under the quarterly decomposition model, there seems to have some "patterns" uncaptured by the seasonality.


### X11 Decomposition

Next, I will use X11 decomposition method.



```{r}
temp <- df_1_ts %>%
  filter(data_series == interested_cpi_item) %>%
  model(X_13ARIMA_SEATS(cpi ~ x11())) %>%
  report()

```
```{r}
objects(temp)

```

```{r}
df_1_ts %>%
  filter(data_series == interested_cpi_item) %>%
  model(X_13ARIMA_SEATS(cpi ~ x11())) %>%
  components() %>%
  autoplot()

```


Do refer to this [instruction manual](https://www2.census.gov/software/x-13arima-seats/x13as/windows/documentation/docx13as.pdf) if you want to find out the arguments can be accepted by the functions.


For example, by default, the seasonal adjustment decomposition of X11 is set to be pseudo additive.

To change the type of seasonal adjustment decomposition, we will do the following:

- Include the `transform` argument

    - Otherwise, the code will return error even if we are not transforming the data series

- Pass the selected type of seasonal adjustment decomposition calculation to the `mode` argument


page 224

```{r}
df_1_ts %>%
  filter(data_series == interested_cpi_item) %>%
  model(X_13ARIMA_SEATS(cpi ~ transform(`function` = "none") + x11(mode = "add"))) %>%
  report()

```


Also, the manual mentioned above is also applicable for the `SEATS` decomposition method that I am covering next.


### SEATS Decomposition

Next, I will use `SEATS` to decompose the time series.

To do so, we can either just pass in the time series into `X_13ARIMA_SEATS` function without specifying the specs or explicitly indicate the specs should be `seats`.

*Method 1: Without specifying the specs*

```{r}
df_1_ts %>%
  filter(data_series == interested_cpi_item) %>%
  model(X_13ARIMA_SEATS(cpi)) %>%
  components() %>%
  autoplot()

```

*Method 2: Explicitly specify the specs as `seats`*

```{r}
df_1_ts %>%
  filter(data_series == interested_cpi_item) %>%
  model(X_13ARIMA_SEATS(cpi ~ seats())) %>%
  components() %>%
  autoplot()

```


Note that the graph does not mention which adjustment is being selected when `seats` specs is used to decompose the time series.


Similarly, the `report` function allows to check the model output result.

```{r}
df_1_ts %>%
  filter(data_series == interested_cpi_item) %>%
  model(X_13ARIMA_SEATS(cpi ~ seats())) %>%
  report()

```


### STL Decomposition

Lastly, I will use `STL` function to decompose the time series.

As such, I will use the `STL` function from `feasts` package to perform the task.

```{r}
df_1_ts %>%
  filter(data_series == interested_cpi_item) %>%
  model(STL(cpi)) %>%
  components()

```

As usual, I will pass the components to `autoplot` function to visualize the graph.

```{r}
df_1_ts %>%
  filter(data_series == interested_cpi_item) %>%
  model(STL(cpi)) %>%
  components() %>%
  autoplot()

```

`STL` function also allows the users to pass in additional parameters.

For example, in the previous STL graph, the season is set as "yearly" as there is a "_year" beside "season".

We can modify the seasonality by passing the information to `season` argument as shown below.


```{r}
df_1_ts %>%
  filter(data_series == interested_cpi_item) %>%
  model(STL(cpi ~ season(3))) %>%
  components() %>%
  autoplot()

```

The graph will show the number of observations in each seasonal period we have indicated in the earlier argument.


For more information on the parameters allowed, please refer to the documentation page.
